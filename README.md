This analysis *was then redone* by Ali based on this code, so *this is not the final version*. In particular, we identified a sampling bias in the MOSAiC balloon data that made the results much more statistically significant once it was accounted for. The final code to produce the analysis in the paper is persistently archived [here](http://zenodo.org/records/13763472) and available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/alistairduffey/ABL_CMIP6/tree/v1).

I made a video for Ali summarising the analysis presented in this repo, you can find it here:

BLWG is an abbreviation of the Boundary Layer Working Group. You can find the original NP drifting station _surface_ data [here](https://nsidc.org/data/g01962/versions/1), and the sonde data [here](https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0060/versions/1).
